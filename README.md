Implement a landing page for a marketplace called Particles that connects companies with software talent specializing in web technologies. The page should have the following sections:

Hero section:
- Headline: "Hire Top Web Developers on Particles"
- Subheading: "Particles is the leading marketplace for companies to find and hire highly skilled web developers specializing in React, Node.js, .NET, Go, and JavaScript."
- Call-to-action button: "View Developer Listings"

Benefits section:
- Benefit 1: Access to a curated pool of top web development talent 
- Benefit 2: Streamlined hiring process to find the right developers quickly
- Benefit 3: Flexibility to hire for project-based or full-time roles

How it Works section:
- Step 1: Browse developer listings and filter by technology and location
- Step 2: Review developer profiles, skills, and experience 
- Step 3: Message developers directly to discuss opportunities
- Step 4: Hire developers through Particles and only pay if satisfied

Use a modern, professional design with a tech-focused color scheme. Include relevant imagery related to web development and hiring.
